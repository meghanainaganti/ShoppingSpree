Deviations:
Our original development plan included the store directory, mall map, and individual store information for the alpha release.
We did those three pages, and added the bookmarked stores and the navigation bar in this release as well. We added these pages in order to more evenly distribute our work among all of our releases, as we realized we would have too many pages to create in later releases if we did not add more features to the Alpha release.
We did not completely finish the bookmark page because we didnâ€™t finish adding the feature to add stores to the bookmarks page
